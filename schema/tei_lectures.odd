        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>This document describes how the TEI standard was customized for the project
            <emph>Lectures that Link</emph>. The project focuses on building a data collection of
          Digital Humanities lecture series hosted by European institutions between 2014 and early
          2025. The primary emphasis is on the lecture series themselves, the individual lectures
          within these series, and the speakers involved. Detailed descriptions of who these data
          were collected and encoded in TEI are provided in the following sections, with examples
          included in the running text.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="sources">
        <head>Data Sources and Strategy for Data Selection and Capture</head>
        <p>All data used in this project was exclusively sourced from publicly accessible websites,
          ensuring that only freely available information was included. Data behind authentication
          barriers, such as those requiring login credentials, was deliberately excluded from the
          collection process.</p>
        <p>In addition to textual information about the lecture series found on individual websites,
          additional digital materials related to the events were incorporated into the project.
          These sources were accessed via hyperlinks found on the websites and include
          presentations, blog posts, related articles, and audiovisual content, such as videos.</p>
        <p>While every effort has been made to ensure the dataset is comprehensive within the scope
          of the project, it does not claim to be exhaustive or definitive. Instead, it serves as a
          solid foundation for both the current and future analyses.</p>

        <div xml:id="series">
          <head>Hierarchical Organization: Series, Terms, and Lectures</head>
          <p>All lecture series are recorded in the <gi>listEvent</gi> element, which is located
            within <gi>body</gi>, a sub-element of <gi>text</gi>. To accurately reflect the inherent
            structure of lecture series, the XML is organized hierarchically. The term <emph>lecture
              series</emph> implies a three-tiered structure:</p>
          <list rend="numbered">
            <item>The overarching series, representing the general lecture program.</item>
            <item>Individual editions or rounds of a series, typically aligned with academic
              semesters or other specific time periods.</item>
            <item>Individual lectures, which form the lowest hierarchical level, with most
              information.</item>
          </list>
          <p>To represent this hierarchy, the following approach is used:</p>
          <p>Each lecture series is recorded within an <gi>event</gi> element, with the
              <att>type</att> attribute set to the value <val>lecture-series</val>. Additionally,
            the <att>where</att> attribute references the ID of the location where the series is
            hosted:</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <event xml:id="ls10" type="lecture-series" where="#rostock">
              <eventName xml:lang="de">Digital Humanities im Fokus: Methoden, Anwendungen und
                Perspektiven</eventName>
              <eventName xml:lang="en">Digital Humanities in Focus: Methods, Applications, and
                Perspectives</eventName>
            </event>
          </egXML>
          <p>The <gi>event</gi> element contains an <gi>eventName</gi> sub-element, which records
            the original name of the series. The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute specifies the
            language of the lecture series name. If official translations exist, multiple
              <gi>eventName</gi> elements may be listed sequentially, as can be seen above.</p>
          <p>Each lecture series consists of at least one, but usually multiple <gi>event</gi>
            elements, each representing an instance of the lecture series, for instance, an academic
            term in which the series took place. These <gi>event</gi> elements include a
              <att>type</att> attribute with the value <val>lecture-series-term</val>, as well as
            the attributes <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> indicating the termâ€™s duration (year
            and month):</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <event xml:id="ls10_t1" type="lecture-series-term" from="2023-04" to="2024-07">

              />
            </event>
          </egXML>
          <p>If a consolidated program overview is available for a given term, a <gi>ptr</gi>
            element is included after the <gi>eventName</gi> element. The <att>type</att> attribute
            of <gi>ptr</gi> is set to the value <val>programme</val> to indicate its purpose.</p>
          <p>After these term-level <gi>event</gi> elements, individual lectures are recorded, as
            explained in the following sections.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="lectures">
          <head>Encoding Individual Lectures</head>
          <p>A individual lecture is recorded as an <gi>event</gi> element with the attribute
              <att>type</att> (with the value <val>lecture</val>) and with the attribute
              <att>when</att>, which specifies the date of the event in the format year-month-day.
            The structure of the content within each <gi>event</gi> element remains consistent
            across all lectures. Therefore, it is described in the following subsections from top to
            bottom, using the example below:</p>

            <head>Keywords</head>
            <p>Each recorded lecture is assigned keywords by the encoders to be able to analyze the
              distribution of disciplines, methods and topics across the lectures and lecture
              series. That is, the keywords are not collected from the websites of the lecture
              series but they are added by the editors of this data collection.</p>
            <p>The keywords are stored inside of a <gi>note</gi> element, characterized by the
              attribute <att>type</att> with the value <val>keywords</val>. Within this
                <gi>note</gi> element, there are two <gi>term</gi> elements:</p>
            <list>
              <item>One with <tag>type="discipline"</tag>, specifying the academic discipline or
                disciplines covered by the talk.</item>
              <item>One with <tag>type="topics-llm"</tag>, indicating the topics of the talk.</item>
            </list>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <note type="keywords">
                <term type="discipline" corresp="#literary-studies"/>
                <term type="topics-llm">evolution, cultural change, computational methods,
                  literature trends, causal mechanisms</term>
              </note>
            </egXML>
            <p>In case that there is more than one discipline, it is collected in the
                <att>corresp</att> attribute of the same <gi>term</gi> element. We opted for this
              (instead of using an individual <gi>term</gi> element for each keyword) to facilitate
              later processing of the data and for a more compact encoding of the information. For
              the disciplines, we use a pre-defined list that we created on our own. The topics were
              generated with a script calling an LLM.</p>
            <p>Both discipline and topic assignments are based on the lecture content. This
              classification relies on the abstract and title of the lecture. Since every lecture
              has a title but not necessarily an abstract, classification is always possible.
              However, a longer title or the presence of an abstract allows for a more precise
              categorization.</p>

          <div xml:id="realization">
            <head>Realization (Lecture Modality)</head>
            <p>The lecture modality is recorded in the <tag>note type="realization"</tag> tag,
              specifying whether the lecture was held in person, hybrid, or online. The
                <gi>note</gi> element contains two <gi>term</gi> sub-elements that define the
              modality separately for speakers and audience members. These <gi>term</gi> elements
              use the <att>type</att> attribute to distinguish between the modality of the speech
              and of the audience:</p>
            <list>
              <item><tag>term type="speech"</tag>: Describes how the speakers delivered the

            <head>Speakers, Titles, and Affiliation</head>
            <p>The speakers of a lecture are recorded in a <gi>listPerson</gi> element. Each speaker
              is described using a <gi>person</gi> element with a <att>corresp</att> attribute that
              links to the corresponding person entry in the TEI header. The academic title (if
              provided) is stored within a <tag>roleName type="title"</tag> element inside of the
                <gi>name</gi> element. The speakerâ€™s affiliation is captured within an
                <gi>affiliation</gi> element, referencing the corresponding institution, which is
              encoded in the TEI header. The information about the speakers, their affiliations, and
              the institutions is encoded in two places for the following reasons: on the one hand,
              we aim to have a centralized list of people and institutions in the TEI header, to
              which we can refer from individual events. On the other hand, the affiliations of
              people can change over time and the same is true for their titles. One person might
              not have a title at the moment of one event, but might have a title at another event
              later on, for instance, if someone completed his or her PhD. Therefore, information
              about the current affiliation of a speaker at the moment of the event and about the
              current title that a person has when the event takes place is encoded directly inside
              of the individual event.</p>

            <p>The titles of the speaker(s) are recorded according to the information provided in
              the lecture program, supporting materials (slides, videos, or blog posts), or a short
              biography. Common academic titles include:</p>
            <list>
              <item>Dr. / Dr.-Ing. / PhD</item>
              <item>PD (Priv.-Doz.)</item>
              <item>Asst. Prof. / Assoc. Prof. / Jun.-Prof. / Prof. (Univ.-Prof.)</item>
            </list>
            <p>These titles are standardized. For instance, "Univ.-Prof." is simplified to "Prof.",
              and variations in spelling (e.g., "PhD" and "Ph.D.") are standardized.</p>
            <p>Academic degrees such as <emph>Bakkalaureus Artium / Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)</emph>
              and <emph>Magister Artium / Master of Arts (M.A.)</emph> are not recorded, as they are
              typically not included in the program. Similarly, if no title is available, the value
                <val>not found</val> is used:</p>

          <div xml:id="hosts_organizers">
            <head>Hosts and Organizers</head>
            <p>Hosts are recorded at the end of the individual lecture entry to indicate which
              organizations were responsible for hosting the lecture, i.e., those that invited the
              speaker(s). The host institution is specified with an <gi>org</gi> element that
              includes the attribute <att>role</att> with the standardized value
                <val>host-institution</val>. The <att>corresp</att> attribute references the
              corresponding organization entry in the TEI header. This value is recorded
              independently of the lecture modality (i.e., in presence, hybrid, or online).</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <org role="host-institution" corresp="#uni-rostock"/>
            </egXML>
            <p>As mentioned above, information about the hosting institutions concludes the section
              for an individual lecture. However, the final element within a lecture series term is
              the information about the organizers of the term. This information is stored within an
                <gi>org</gi> element with the attribute <att>role</att> and the standardized value
                <val>organizer</val>.</p>

                corresp="#henny-krahmer_ulrike #alvares-freire_fernanda #renz_erik"/>
            </egXML>
            <p>Unlike host institutions, which are organizations, organizers are recorded as
              individual persons, as can be seen in the example above. It is possible for an
              organizer to also be a speaker in another lecture series or even in their own
              series.</p>
            <p>Since organizational responsibility can change from term to term, it is considered
              appropriate to record this information at this level rather than for the entire
              series.</p>

          <head>Creating IDs</head>
          <p>The dataset assigns unique IDs to lecture series, lecture series terms, individual
            lectures, persons, organizations, and locations, which are consistently stored in the
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The following aspects must be considered when creating
            IDs:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Lowercase only: All IDs are written exclusively in lowercase.</item>
            <item>No numbers: Numbers are not used in IDs.</item>
            <item>Latin script only: The Latin script is consistently applied.</item>
            <item>No diacritical marks: Diacritical marks (e.g., Ã¤, Ã¶, Ã¼, Ã¢, Ãª, Ã®) are completely
              removed or replaced with corresponding transliterations (e.g., Ã¤ â†’ ae, Ã¶ â†’ oe, Ã¨ â†’
              e).</item>
          </list>
          <p>Additional considerations include:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Standardized prefixes: Certain IDs, such as those for universities, always begin
              with a fixed prefix (e.g., <val>uni-</val> for universities, <val>fh-</val> for
              universities of applied sciences).</item>
            <item>Use of hyphens and underscores: Two types of separators are used in the dataset: <list>
                <item>Underscores (<val>_</val>) are used exclusively for person IDs, separating the
                  surname from the given name.</item>
                <item>Hyphens (<val>-</val>) are used for organizations and locations to separate
                  individual name components (e.g., multi-word city names). In person IDs, hyphens
                  are used to connect multiple given names or multiple surnames.</item>

        <div xml:id="language">
          <head>Capturing Language</head>
          <p>All collected information is recorded exclusively in the languages in which it appears
            on the respective websites. Each element of a lecture event that contains textual
            information in a certain language is marked with the attribute <att>xml:lang</att>,
            specifying the corresponding language value, such as <val>en</val> for English or
              <val>de</val> for German. No translations of content are produced.</p>
          <p>The documentation of series, terms and lectures is mainly focused on English, Italian,
            German, Spanish, French and Portuguese, due to the language knowledge of the
            collaborators in this project. Other languages can be included, especially when it comes
            to recording the names of organizations or places. By default, these informations are
            documented in the language in which they originally emerged, which may differ from the
            respective national language.</p>
          <p>In some cases, a title may include multiple languages, whether for stylistic reasons or
            because it contains a key term discussed in the lecture or an introductory quotation. In
            such instances, only the primary language of the title is recorded, while additional
            languages are not documented, as shown in the following example:</p>

              <p>The talk will focus on the study of digital collections of early modern printed

          <p>In such cases, the primary language of the element must be identified and recorded. In
            the example above, this would be English. The primary language can often be determined
            by identifying which part of the content conveys the core subject matter rather than
            serving a decorative or stylistic function. For titles, another useful indicator is the
            language of the accompanying abstract, if available.</p>

            from the Internet Archive (<ref target="https://web.archive.org/"
              >https://web.archive.org/</ref>). This archiving process applies to all links, except
            for DOI links, which are permanent by definition and do not require additional
            archiving. However, links that lead to videos, such as those on YouTube, are not
            archived because archiving by the Wayback Machine is not possible in this case.</p>
          <p>All links within the dataset are encoded using the <gi>ptr</gi> (pointer) element.
            Within this element, the <att>type</att> attribute is used to specify the exact role of

        <div xml:id="organizations">
          <head>Capturing Organizations</head>
          <p>Organizations involved in Digital Humanities lecture series are divided into two main
            roles: the affiliation of the (invited) speaker and the hosting venue.</p>
          <p>In most cases, organizations are listed at the level of entire universities, research
            institutions, or cultural institutions. Specific departments or institutes within these
            organizations, where speakers may be affiliated, are not captured in the data. E.g. if
            an affiliation to the Institute of German Studies at the University of Rostock is
            mentioned in a program, only the University of Rostock is encoded.</p>
          <p>Each organization is represented by a separate entry within the <gi>particDesc</gi>
            element, found under <gi>listOrg</gi>. The <gi>org</gi> sub-element defines the
            organization and is assigned a unique ID through the <att>xml:id</att> attribute. This
            ID is used throughout the dataset to ensure consistent referencing. Additionally, the
              <att>type</att> attribute within the <gi>org</gi> element is employed to specify the
            organization's precise role. Available values for the <att>type</att> attribute
            include:</p>
          <list>
            <item><val>university</val>: for universities and universities of applied
              sciences</item>
            <item><val>research_institution</val>: for private or public institutions that conduct
              research</item>
            <item><val>company</val>: for companies or private sector organizations</item>
            <item><val>glam</val>: for galleries, libraries, archives, museums; generally, all
              cultural and memory institutions</item>
            <item><val>other</val>: we use this when none of the categories listed above apply, for
              example in the case of radio stations or newspapers.</item>
          </list>
          <p>As can be seen in the example below, the "UniversitÃ  di Bologna" is represented as an
            organization with the ID <val>uni-bologna</val>. The name of the organization is
            presented in the original language (Italian, in this case), and an external Wikidata
            identifier is included within the <gi>idno</gi> element.</p>

            <head>Universities</head>
            <p>As described above, all organizations, including all university entries, are assigned
              an ID. Unlike those of other organizations, university IDs always begin with
                <val>uni-</val> or <val>fh-</val> followed by a unique part, typically derived from
              the name or location of the institution. For example, the University of Rostock is
              captured as follows:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <org xml:id="uni-rostock" type="university">
                <name xml:lang="de">UniversitÃ¤t Rostock</name>
                <idno type="wikidata">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q159895</idno>
                <place corresp="#rostock"/>
              </org>
            </egXML>
            <p>In order to maintain clarity and allow for future adjustments, the names of
              universities are standardized. For instance, "Julius-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t WÃ¼rzburg"
              is shortened to "UniversitÃ¤t WÃ¼rzburg", and the corresponding ID becomes
                <val>uni-wuerzburg</val>:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <org xml:id="uni-wuerzburg" type="university">
                <name xml:lang="de">UniversitÃ¤t WÃ¼rzburg</name>
                <idno type="wikidata">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q161976</idno>
                <place corresp="#wuerzburg"/>
              </org>
            </egXML>
            <p>This simplification also reduces the need for updates when a university undergoes
              rebranding or changes its name, such as in the case of the recent shift in MÃ¼nster
              from "WestfÃ¤lische Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nster" to "UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nster".</p>
            <p>When multiple universities exist within the same city, additional distinctions are
              added to the ID to avoid confusion. These distinctions are appended to the base ID
              formed by the university's type and location. For example, in London, where several
              institutions exist, their IDs are distinguished as follows:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <org xml:id="uni-london-city" type="university">

          <p>Each speaker included in the dataset is represented by an individual entry within the
              <gi>listPerson</gi> element, specifically under <gi>particDesc</gi>.</p>
          <p>To ensure consistent identification, every speaker is assigned a unique ID through the
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute. This identifier follows a standardized format, combining
            the speaker's surname and given name, separated by an underscore. In cases where a
            speaker has multiple given or family names, these are connected using hyphens. For
            example:</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <person xml:id="maget-dominice_antoinette">
              <name>
                <forename>Antoinette</forename>
                <surname>Maget DominicÃ©</surname>

              <idno type="wikidata">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102211240</idno>
            </person>
          </egXML>
          <p>As shown above, each entry also records the speaker's social gender, represented by the
              <gi>gender</gi> element within the <gi>person</gi> element. The primary values for
            this element are <val>female</val> and <val>male</val>. The gender assignment is based
            primarily on the typical gender associations of given names. Additionally, where
            available, information from Wikidata and other external databases has been used to
            verify gender identity. If research indicates that a person does not fall within the
            binary gender spectrum, they are assigned the value <val>non-binary</val>. It should be
            noted that assigning gender based on name connotations is inherently prone to errors.
            While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy through external sources, there may
            still be instances where the assigned gender does not align with the individual's
            self-identification.</p>
          <p>Each speaker entry includes a <gi>name</gi> element, which further contains
              <gi>forename</gi> and <gi>surname</gi> sub-elements. These store the full given name
            and surname of the individual without abbreviations or alterations.</p>
          <p>Additionally, every speaker entry includes at least one, but typically two,
              <gi>idno</gi> elements. These elements reference external identifiers. One of these
            identifiers is the <val>orcid</val>, a researcher-specific identifier maintained by the
            speaker themselves, while the second is a <val>wikidata</val> ID. If a Wikidata entry
            does not already exist for a given speaker, a new record is created.</p>

        <div xml:id="locations">
          <head>Capturing Locations</head>
          <p>Each location in the dataset is represented by an individual entry within the
              <gi>listPlace</gi> element, specifically under <gi>settingDesc</gi>. There are three
            types of entries: for continents, for countries and for cities. This distinction is made
            using the <att>type</att> attribute, which takes either the value <val>continent</val>,
              <val>country</val> or <val>city</val>.</p>
          <p>All location names are recorded in English or using the vernacular form if no English
            form is knowsn, following the naming conventions in place at the time of data
            collection.</p>
          <p>To ensure consistent identification, each location is assigned a unique ID using the
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute. In most cases, this ID matches the name of the city,
            country or continent. However, exceptions are made when a city shares the same name as
            the country it belongs to, such as Luxembourg City in Luxembourg. The same rule applies
            to city-states:</p>

          <p>Each city entry includes a <gi>name</gi> element that records the full name of the
            place without abbreviations or modifications. Additionally, every city entry contains a
              <gi>country</gi> element, which links the city to its corresponding country via the
              <att>ref</att> attribute.</p>
          <p>Each city entry also includes an <gi>idno</gi> element. Using the <att>type</att>
            attribute, this element provides a reference to the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names
            (TGN), ensuring precise identification of the location.</p>
